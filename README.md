A few years ago I had to opportunity to visit the Titanic Museum in Belfast.  I learned about the lives of many of the passengers and what they had to endure that day.  When we entered the museum, we were given a name of one of the passengers and that is who we were “supposed to be” during our visit.  At the end of the tour, we got to find out if we survived or perished.  I didn’t make it.  I got to wondering why some people survived and some didn't.  Was is just luck, or were there certain characteristics that gave a person a better chance at survival?  This is the basis for my investigation of the Titanic dataset. 

This project is based off the titanic3.csv dataset that is available [here](https://github.com/jbryer/CompStats/blob/master/Data/titanic3.csv).
